What works?
- dummy backend compiles, MuleApplication works too
- LEGO EV3 backend compiles, but not all functions are finished

What doesn't work?
- LEGO EV3 and Raspberry Pi backends are untested and unfinished
- Windows is not supported without Cygwin
- Need to implement MuleSound and MuleVoice classes. They will depend on libalsa2 on Linux or QNX sound architecture on QNX, as well as espeak will possibly be used as a backend for MuleVoice

==== Notes about MuleSound ====
LEGO EV3 has an extremely obsolete version of the Linux kernel (2.6.33) and, as such, I'll have to use this version of libalsa2: http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/mandriva/2010.0/i586/media/main/testing/libalsa2-1.0.21a-1.0.3mdv2010.0.i586.html
